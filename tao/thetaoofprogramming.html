	<h3>1.1</h3>
	<p>
	Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void.  Waiting alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion.  It is the source of all programs.  I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming.
	</p>
	<p>
	If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great.  If the operating system is great, then the compiler is great.  If the compiler is great, then the application is great.  The user is pleased and there exists harmony in the world.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of morning.
	</p>
</article>

<article>
	<h3>1.2</h3>
	<p> The Tao gave birth to machine language.  Machine language gave birth to
	the assembler.
	</p>
	<p>
	The assembler gave birth to the compiler.  Now there are ten thousand
	languages.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Each language has its purpose, however humble.  Each language expresses
	the Yin and Yang of software.  Each language has its place within the
	Tao.
	</p>
	<p> 
	But do not program in <tt>COBOL</tt> if you can avoid it.
	</p>

</article>

<article>	
	<h3>1.3</h3>

	<p> In the beginning was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to Space and Time.
	Therefore Space and Time are Yin and Yang of programming.

	</p><p> Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of
	time and space for their programs. Programmers that comprehend the
	Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals.

	</p><p> How could it be otherwise?

</article>

<article>	
	</p><h3>1.4</h3>

	<p> 
	The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. The average
	programmer is told about Tao and searches for it. The foolish
	programmer is told about Tao and laughs at it.

	</p><p> If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.

	</p><p> The highest sounds are hardest to hear. <br>
	Going forward is a way to retreat. <br>
	Great talent shows itself late in life. <br>
	Even a perfect program still has bugs. <br>

	<p> The programmers of old were mysterious and profound.  We cannot fathom
	their thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.

	</p><p> Aware, like a fox crossing the water.  Alert, like a general on the
	battlefield. Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests.  Simple, like
	uncarved blocks of wood.  Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves.

	<p> Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine.  When he awoke
	he exclaimed:

	<blockquote>

	<p> A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software
	conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying:  &ldquo;What
	sort of programmers work for other companies?  They behaved badly and
	were unconcerned with appearances.  There hair was long and unkempt
	and their clothes were wrinkled and old.  They crashed our hospitality
	suite and they made rude noises during my presentation.&rdquo;

	</p>
	<p> The manager said:  &ldquo;I should have never sent you to the conference.
	Those programmers live beyond the physical world. They consider life
	absurd, an accidental coincidence. They come and go without knowing
	limitations. Without a care, they live only for their programs. Why
	should they bother with social conventions?

	</p>
	<p> &ldquo;They are alive within the Tao.&rdquo;

	<p> A novice asked the Master:  &ldquo;Here is a programmer that never designs,
	documents or tests his programs.  Yet all who know him consider him
	one of the best programmers in the world.  Why is this?&rdquo;

	</p><p> The Master replies:  &ldquo;That programmer has mastered the Tao.  He has
	gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the
	system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has gone
	beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else
	sees his code.  He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his
	programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their
	purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao.&rdquo;

	<p> There once was a man who went to a computer trade show.  Each day as
	he entered, the man told the guard at the door:

	</p>
	<blockquote>
	      <p>
	      &ldquo;I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting. Be
	      forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered.&rdquo;
	      </p>
	</blockquote>

	<p> This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions
	of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man
	carefully.  But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming
	quietly to himself.

	</p>
	<p> When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,
	but nothing was to be found.

	</p><p> On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the guard
	saying:  &ldquo;I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even
	better.&rdquo; So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.

	</p>
	<p> On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his curiosity
	no longer.  &ldquo;Sir Thief,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am so perplexed, I cannot live in
	peace.  Please enlighten me.  What is it that you are stealing?&rdquo;

	</p>
	<p> The man smiled.  &ldquo;I am stealing ideas,&rdquo; he said.

	<h3>3.2</h3>

	<p> There once was a master programmer who wrote unstructured programs.
	A novice programmer, seeking to imitate him, also began to write
	unstructured programs.  When the novice asked the master to evaluate
	his progress, the master criticized him for writing unstructured
	programs, saying, &ldquo;What is appropriate for the master is not
	appropriate for the novice.  You must understand the Tao before
	transcending structure.&rdquo;

	<h3>3.3</h3>

	<p> There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the
	warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked the programmer:  &ldquo;Which is easier to
	design: an accounting package or an operating system?&rdquo;

	</p><p> &ldquo;An operating system,&rdquo; replied the programmer.

	</p><p> The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  &ldquo;Surely an accounting
	package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system,&rdquo; he said.

	</p><p> &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said the programmer, &ldquo;when designing an accounting package,
	the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different
	ideas:  how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it
	must conform to the tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not
	limited by outside appearances.  When designing an operating system,
	the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas.
	This is why an operating system is easier to design.&rdquo;

	</p><p> The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  &ldquo;That is all good and well, but
	which is easier to debug?&rdquo;

	</p><p> The programmer made no reply.

	<p> A manager went to the master programmer and showed him the requirements
	document for a new application.  The manager asked the master:  &ldquo;How
	long will it take to design this system if I assign five programmers to it?&rdquo;

	</p><p> &ldquo;It will take one year,&rdquo; said the master promptly.

	</p><p> &ldquo;But we need this system immediately or even sooner!  How long will it
	take if I assign ten programmers to it?&rdquo;

	</p><p> The master programmer frowned.  &ldquo;In that case, it will take two years.&rdquo;

	</p><p> &ldquo;And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it?&rdquo;

	</p><p> The master programmer shrugged.  &ldquo;Then the design will never be
	completed,&rdquo; he said.

<p class="masterspoke"> &ldquo;A well-written program is its own heaven; a poorly-written program is its
own hell.&rdquo;

</p>

<article>
	<h3>4.1</h3>

	<p> A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a
	string of pearls.  The spirit and intent of the program should be
	retained throughout.  There should be neither too little or too much,
	neither needless loops nor useless variables, neither lack of
	structure nor overwhelming rigidity.

	</p><p> A program should follow the `Law of Least Astonishment'.  What is this
	law?  It is simply that the program should always respond to the user
	in the way that astonishes him least.

	</p><p> A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit.  The program
	should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward appearances.

	</p><p> If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of
	disorder and confusion.  The only way to correct this is to rewrite
	the program.

	</p>

	<h3>4.2</h3>

	<p> A novice asked the master: &ldquo;I have a program that sometime runs and
	sometimes aborts.  I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am
	totally baffled.  What is the reason for this?&rdquo;

	</p><p> The master replied: &ldquo;You are confused because you do not understand
	Tao.  Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.
	Why do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed?
	Computers simulate determinism; only Tao is perfect.

	</p><p> &ldquo;The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is eternal.
	Therefore you must contemplate Tao before you receive enlightenment.&rdquo;

	</p><p> &ldquo;But how will I know when I have received enlightenment?&rdquo; asked the
	novice.

	</p><p> &ldquo;Your program will then run correctly,&rdquo; replied the master.

	<p> A master was explaining the nature of Tao of to one of his novices.
	&ldquo;The Tao is embodied in all software - regardless of how
	insignificant,&rdquo; said the master.

	</p><p> &ldquo;Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?&rdquo; asked the novice.

	</p><p> &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; came the reply.

	</p><p> &ldquo;Is the Tao in a video game?&rdquo; continued the novice.

	</p><p> &ldquo;It is even in a video game,&rdquo; said the master.

	</p><p> &ldquo;And is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer?&rdquo;

	</p><p> The master coughed and shifted his position slightly. &ldquo;The lesson
	is over for today,&rdquo; he said.

	<p> Prince Wang's programmer was coding software.  His fingers danced upon
	the keyboard.  The program compiled without an error message, and the
	program ran like a gentle wind.

	</p><p> &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; the Prince exclaimed, &ldquo;Your technique is faultless!&rdquo;

	</p><p> &ldquo;Technique?&rdquo; said the programmer turning from his terminal, &ldquo;What I
	follow is Tao - beyond all techniques!  When I first began to program
	I would see before me the whole problem in one mass.  After three
	years I no longer saw this mass.  Instead, I used subroutines.  But now
	I see nothing.  My whole being exists in a formless void.  My senses
	are idle.  My spirit, free to work without plan, follows its own
	instinct.  In short, my program writes itself.  True, sometimes there
	are difficult problems.  I see them coming, I slow down, I watch
	silently.  Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties
	vanish like puffs of idle smoke.  I then compile the program.  I sit
	still and let the joy of the work fill my being.  I close my eyes for
	a moment and then log off.&rdquo;

	</p><p> Prince Wang said, &ldquo;Would that all of my programmers were as wise!&rdquo;

	<p> A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish
	the program on which he was working.  &ldquo;It will be finished tomorrow,&rdquo;
	the programmer promptly replied.

	</p><p> &ldquo;I think you are being unrealistic,&rdquo; said the manager, &ldquo;Truthfully,
	how long will it take?&rdquo;

	</p><p> The programmer thought for a moment. &ldquo;I have some features that I
	wish to add. This will take at least two weeks,&rdquo; he finally said.

	</p><p> &ldquo;Even that is too much to expect,&rdquo; insisted the manager, &ldquo;I will be
	satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.&rdquo;

	</p><p> The programmer agreed to this.

<article>
	<h3>6.1</h3>

	<p> When managers hold endless meetings, the programmers write games.
	When accountants talk of quarterly profits, the development budget
	is about to be cut.  When senior scientists talk blue sky, the clouds
	are about to roll in.

	</p><p> Truly, this is not the Tao of Programming.

	<h3>6.2</h3>

	<p> Why are programmers non-productive? <br>

	</p><p> The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer
	refused it, saying, &ldquo;I wrote the program because I thought it was
	an interesting concept, and thus I expect no reward.&rdquo;

	</p><p> The manager upon hearing this remarked, &ldquo;This programmer, though he
	holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty
	of an employee.  Let us promote him to the exalted position of
	management consultant!&rdquo;

	</p><p> But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying,

	to visit, &ldquo;I have my own operating system and file storage device.
	I do not have to share my resources with anyone.  The software is self-
	consistent and easy-to-use.  Why do you not quit your present job and
	join me here?&rdquo;

	</p><p> The mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his friend,
	saying &ldquo;The mainframe sits like an ancient sage meditating in the midst
	of the data center.  Its disk drives lie end-to-end like a great ocean of
	machinery.  The software is as multifaceted as a diamond, and as convoluted
	as a primeval jungle.  The programs, each unique, move through the system
	like a swift-flowing river.  That is why I am happy where I am.&rdquo;

	</p><p> The microcomputer programmer, upon hearing this, fell silent. But the
	two programmers remained friends until the end of their days.

	<p> Hardware met Software on the road to Changtse.  Software said:  &ldquo;You
	are Yin and I am Yang.  If we travel together we will become famous
	and earn vast sums of money.&rdquo;  And so the set forth together, thinking
	to conquer the world.

	</p><p> Presently they met Firmware, who was dressed in tattered rags and
	hobbled along propped on a thorny stick.  Firmware said to them:
	&ldquo;The Tao lies beyond Yin and Yang. It is silent and still as a pool
	of water.  It does not seek fame, therefore nobody knows its presence.
	It does not seek fortune, for it is complete within itself.  It exists
	beyond space and time.&rdquo;

	</p><p> Software and Hardware, ashamed, returned to their homes.
